## QuickSort Overview
QuickSort is a popular sorting algorithm based on the **Divide and Conquer** strategy. Here's how it works:

1. **Pivot Selection**: Choose an element from the array as the **pivot**.
2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the array such that all elements less than the pivot are on its left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on its right.
3. **Recursion**: Recursively apply the above steps to the left and right subarrays.

The key process in QuickSort is the **partitioning** step, where the pivot is placed in its correct position in the sorted array. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

## Example of Partitioning
Let's take an example array: `arr[] = {10, 80, 30, 90, 40}`.

1. Compare the pivot (say, 10) with each element:
   - 80 is greater than the pivot, so it remains on the right.
   - 30 is less than the pivot, so it moves to the left.
   - 90 is greater than the pivot, so it stays on the right.
   - 40 is less than the pivot, so it goes to the left.
2. The pivot (10) is now in its correct position: `{30, 10, 40, 80, 90}`.

## Complexity Analysis
QuickSort's time complexity depends on the choice of pivot and the distribution of elements. Here are some scenarios:

- **Best Case**: When the pivot divides the array into roughly equal halves at each step, the time complexity is Î©(N log N). This occurs when the pivot selection is optimal.
- **Average Case**: In practice, QuickSort performs well with an average-case time complexity of Î˜(N log N).
- **Worst Case**: The worst-case scenario occurs when the pivot selection is unfavorable (e.g., always choosing the smallest or largest element). In this case, the time complexity is O(N^2).

## Experimental Result and Efficiency
To analyze the efficiency, you can:
1. Implement QuickSort in your preferred programming language.
2. Measure the execution time for different input sizes (e.g., arrays of varying lengths).
3. Plot the results to observe the order of growth.

Remember that QuickSort is efficient in practice due to its average-case performance. However, be cautious about worst-case scenarios.

Feel free to experiment with different pivot selection strategies and observe their impact on performance! ðŸš€
